# Experiment 09: Pointer Basics
## Aim

To understand the fundamentals of pointers in C++ and implement various pointer operations like pointer arithmetic, array manipulation, and string traversal.

## Objectives

To learn how pointers store and manipulate memory addresses.

To implement pointer arithmetic (increment, difference).

To use pointers for array operations such as reversal.

To explore pointers in string handling.

To compare memory movement in different data types using pointer increments.

## Theory
### What is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of storing data directly, it “points” to the memory location where data resides.

### Declaration:
```
int *ptr;   // pointer to int
```

### Initialization:
```
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;   // ptr stores address of x
```

### Dereferencing:
```
cout << *ptr;   // prints value stored at address of x
```

### Memory & Pointers

Every variable in C++ is stored at a unique memory address.

Pointers help us:

> Access that address.

> Perform operations relative to that address.

> Manipulate data indirectly.

### Pointer Arithmetic

Pointers can be incremented (ptr++) or decremented (ptr--).

The movement is not by 1 byte, but by the size of the data type.

#### Pointers support limited arithmetic:

Increment (ptr++) → Moves to the next memory block of its data type.

Decrement (ptr--) → Moves to the previous memory block.

Difference (ptr2 - ptr1) → Returns the number of elements between two pointers.

#### Example Table

| Data Type | Size (bytes) | Initial Address | After `ptr++` | 
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| int       | 4            | 1000            | 1004          |
| float     | 4            | 2000            | 2004          |
| bool      | 1            | 3000            | 3001          |
| double    | 8            | 4000            | 4008          |


### Why use Pointers?

> Efficient memory handling

> Dynamic memory allocation

> Array & string manipulation

> Faster access in data structures (linked lists, trees, etc.)

### Advantages of Pointers

Dynamic Memory Allocation: Manage memory during runtime (new, delete).

Efficient Array Handling: Access arrays faster than using indexing.

String Handling: Traverse and manipulate strings easily.

Data Structures: Essential for linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, and queues.

### Real-World Applications

Game Development → Efficient memory handling for 3D objects.

Operating Systems → Pointers used in process management & memory allocation.

Networking → Buffers and data packets handled via pointers.

Embedded Systems → Direct access to hardware memory.

## Program Descriptions

### Creating a pointer & incrementing it

Declared variables of different types (int, float, bool, double).

Printed original and incremented pointer addresses.

Observed how increments differ based on data type size.

### Sum and Difference of Pointers

Used two pointers pointing to different elements of an array.

Calculated the difference in terms of element positions.

Demonstrated how subtraction gives the number of elements between pointers.

### Reversing an Array using Pointers

Accessed array elements via pointers.

Swapped elements from both ends using pointer arithmetic.

Achieved in-place reversal without using extra memory.

### Printing a String using Pointers

Initialized a character array (string).

Used a pointer to traverse until null terminator '\0'.

Printed characters sequentially.

## Concepts Used

Pointer declaration and initialization

Address-of operator &

Dereference operator *

Pointer arithmetic (++, --, subtraction)

Traversing arrays and strings with pointers

Memory representation in C++

## Conclusion
I learnt how pointers can be useful in dynamic memory location, in array handling, and in string handling efficiently. How it makes programming clearer, more efficient and easy to understand and visualize.
